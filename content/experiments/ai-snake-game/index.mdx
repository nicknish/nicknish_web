You are the training algorithm. Your job is to guide this AI agent as it navigates its training environment, collecting data points to improve its model. Be careful though: if the agent crashes into the walls of its sandbox or loops back on its own training history, it is game over.

## Controls

- **Desktop**: Arrow keys or WASD to change direction
- **Mobile**: Swipe in the direction you want to move, or use the on-screen D-pad

## How it works

This is a classic Snake game dressed up in AI training clothes. The snake represents an AI agent exploring its environment. Each data point (the gold dot) it collects increases its training progress. But as the agent grows in complexity (gets longer), it becomes harder to navigate without running into itself. Sound familiar?
