Bonsai is a YCombinator company aimed to be the freelancer business toolkit with contracts,
invoices, accounting, and more.

Only a half year out of YCombinator, I began working on contract to help with the growing demands of
the frontend for Bonsai.

As it became clear that the team needed more than frontend help, I remained on contract but worked
full-time as a full stack developer - implementing entire features using Ruby on Rails, jQuery, and
React-Redux.

It's been the ultimate pleasure to help build tools that I love to use myself.
