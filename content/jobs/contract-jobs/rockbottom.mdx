_Rock Bottom Records was previously known as Bottomfeeder Records._

Rock Bottom Records is an up-and-coming L.A. based record label started by Daniel “Luxo” Nish and
Scott “Posse Sauce” Wolf.

When the Rock Bottom founders approached me, their web presence was taking off due to their playful
brand and cult following. However, they didn't have a website yet and they were in the midst of
redesigning the logo.

Together, we worked through two major design iterations and finally launched the website to the
world.

Built with cutting-edge web technology that not only allows me to build beautiful, responsive
products, the Rock Bottom website is also client-first. It is powered with a superpowered stack so
good that it's unbelievable that it's free: React, Gatsby.js, Contentful, and Netlify.

- React provides lightning fast development and ease for other developers to understand what I did
- Gatsby.js provides a local build tool and the best web performance and SEO out of the box
- Contentful allows the client to change the content on the fly
- Netlify provides a continuous deployment pipeline

Technology Stack: React, GraphQL, Gatsby
