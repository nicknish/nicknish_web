I joined BloomNation in 2015 as a front-end developer to an engineering team of four. My role
revolved around all user-facing BloomNation products, including their marketplace, blog, resource
center for florists, email marketing, and florist tools.

Being apart of a company that helped many business owners survive in challenging times was a huge
learning experience.
