This series explains software development and programming concepts in their most simple (by simple, I don't mean _abstract_) terms. The title is a bit click-baity, but I'm imagining explaining these concepts to myself when I was a junior developer.

When I was learning these concepts, I found many of them intimidating. But when I finally understood them, I realized how simple they actually are. What made them difficult to understand was the terminology and mental baggage surrounding the concept.

My aim is to break these down into their simplest concepts and have this series become a jumping point to other resources if you choose to dive a bit deeper.

Enjoy!
