> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
> â€“ nodejs.org/en/about

That's a whole lot of terminology so let's break it down.

First, Chrome's __V8 Engine__ refers to Google Chrome's JavaScript engine. The browser's JavaScript engine is responsible for reading, understanding, and breaking down JavaScript into machine code in order to run it. Second, the __runtime__ refers to the state at which JavaScript runs in the browser. 

Essentially, Node.js packages the runtime state for JavaScript usage outside of the browser.

But why would we want to run JavaScript out of the browser?

Now, we can write JavaScript not only for the browser, but also as a general programming language to write our [scripts](/blog/explain-it-like-im-5-scripts) to running our [servers](/blog/explain-it-like-im-5-servers). 

Node.js has been at the core of JavaScript's recent explosion in the last few years, driving innovation on the [frontend and the backend](explain-it-like-im-5-frontend-backend-and-full-stack).
