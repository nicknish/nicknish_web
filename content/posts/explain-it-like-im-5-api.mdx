__API__ is short for __Application Programming Interface__. 

An *interface* is simply a predefined way to work with a tool. That tool can be a 3rd party service like Facebook, a library like ReactJS, or your own internal service.

Imagine you want to display your recent tweets on a website. Your first might be to copy the last few tweets into your code. Nice! But now every time you write a tweet, you have to copy the tweet into your website. Damn! Twitter's API solves this by giving you a way to work with their database without needing to work within their application code. Using their API, you can *fetch* your recent tweets, retrieve them as data, and display them however you like.

Real-world examples:

- Facebook API - The way to get data from Facebook like users, friends, likes.
- Twitter API - The way to get data from Twitter like tweets, profiles, followers.
- Stripe API - The way to handle payments using the Stripe service.
- REST API - An API designed to  creove consistency for common operations like create, read, update, and destroy.
