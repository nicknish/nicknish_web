*This post will cover how to create a higher-order component that ensures specific subroutes require authentication. For a primer on react-router I highly suggest reading [Tyler McGinnis's React Router Philosophy blog post](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-philosophy-introduction/).*

When you're building an app you'll often have authenticated routes and unauthenticated routes. These will separate your app’s public pages and private pages which are locked behind a login page. 

For example, you might have a Dashboard page that requires a user to login first. If the user is signed in, they can access these subroutes. If not, then the user will be redirected to the Login page.

## Set up our project

First, let's scaffold a typical React entry point *index.js*. 

```jsx
/* index.js */
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import AppRouter from "./router";
import Navbar from "./Navbar";
import "./styles.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Router>
        <Navbar />
        <AppRouter />
      </Router>
    </div>
  );
};

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

Now, let's create a basic router in *router.js*. We were assigned to create a private Dashboard page, so let's do that first. We'll work on making it private after.

```jsx
/* router.js */
import React from "react";
import { Route, Switch, Redirect } from "react-router-dom";
import { HOME_URL, LOGIN_URL, DASHBOARD_URL } from "./urls";

import Homepage from "./Homepage";
import Login from "./Login";
import Dashboard from "./Dashboard";

const AppRouter = () => (
  <Switch>
    <Route exact path={HOME_URL} component={Homepage} />
    <Route exact path={LOGIN_URL} component={Login} />
    {/* TODO: Require login */}
    <Route exact path={DASHBOARD_URL} component={Dashboard} />
  </Switch>
);

export default AppRouter;
```

We have an app entry point and a router! Now, let's make this Dashboard page private.

## Create a higher-order component that authenticates subroutes

Let's think about what we want to do. We want to:

1. Check that the user is signed in
2. If they're signed in, let them access the Dashboard route (or other private routes)
3. If they're not signed in, redirect them to the Login route

We can create a `RequireAuth` higher order component (or, HOC, a function that takes a new component and returns a new component).

This component will first check if the user is signed in, then it will either redirect to login or allow access to the private routes.

```jsx
/* router.js */

// Simulated authentication obj, maybe this would be retrieved in cookies
export const fakeAuth = {
  signedIn: false
};

const RequireAuth = ({ children }) => {
  if (!fakeAuth.signedIn) {
    return <Redirect to={LOGIN_URL} />;
  }

  return children;
};

// ...AppRouter
```

Now, let’s wrap up our `RequireAuth` HOC around our routes that we want to privatize.

```jsx
/* router.js */

// ... RequireAuth

const AppRouter = () => (
  <Switch>
    <Route exact path={HOME_URL} component={Homepage} />
    <Route exact path={LOGIN_URL} component={Login} />

    <RequireAuth>
      <Route exact path={DASHBOARD_URL} component={Dashboard} />
    </RequireAuth>
  </Switch>
);
```

Let's break this down.

1. We pass our `RequireAuth` component our `Route`s. 
2. `RequireAuth` accesses the `Route`s component using the `children` prop. As you might know, `children` is a special prop that contains the components and HTML that you passed between the opening and closing tags. 
3. `RequireAuth` checks if the user is logged in. (For the sake of this example, we'll simulate checking if a user is authenticated. In a production application a common method is to check a stored cookie to see if the user is logged in.)
4. If the user isn't logged in, they'll be redirected to the Login page.
5. If the user is logged in, they'll have access to the `children`, which includes our Dashboard `Route`.

And we're done! Here's the whole *router.js* file.

```jsx
/* router.js */
import React from "react";
import { Route, Switch, Redirect } from "react-router-dom";
import { HOME_URL, LOGIN_URL, DASHBOARD_URL } from "./urls";

import Homepage from "./Homepage";
import Login from "./Login";
import Dashboard from "./Dashboard";

// Simulated authentication obj, maybe this would be retrieved in cookies
export const fakeAuth = {
  signedIn: false
};

const RequireAuth = ({ children }) => {
  if (!fakeAuth.signedIn) {
    return <Redirect to={LOGIN_URL} />;
  }

  return children;
};

const AppRouter = () => (
  <Switch>
    <Route exact path={HOME_URL} component={Homepage} />
    <Route exact path={LOGIN_URL} component={Login} />

    <RequireAuth>
      <Route exact path={DASHBOARD_URL} component={Dashboard} />
    </RequireAuth>
  </Switch>
);
```

## Live Example

To better illustrate this, I've created a [CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/loving-beaver-wzt2e?autoresize=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1) which you can also preview below.

This example is nearly identical, but I've built out the other components.

Other than the simulated authentication, this setup is nearly identical to how we would approach this in production applications! 

Feel free to share, fork, and play with it right now!
