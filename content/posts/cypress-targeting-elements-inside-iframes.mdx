**[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)** is an automated testing tool that allows you to write
end-to-end tests for your app. It has a fantastically easy-to-use, jQuery-like syntax and is a
powerful and delightful tool for your integration tests.

One major pain point when using Cypress is testing on elements within `iframe`s. Unfortunately,
Cypress can‚Äôt easily target elements within an `iframe` without a bit of extra work.

Worse, their documentation on doing so is a
[sad paragraph in their FAQ](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/using-cypress-faq.html#How-do-I-test-elements-inside-an-iframe)
so you‚Äôll wind up combing through loads of GitHub Issues (for extra reading
[this issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/136) is the best you'll find).

This post outlines some lessons learned and some simple Cypress custom commands that make working
with `iframe`s a breeze.

## Disable `chromeWebSecurity`

First, if your `iframe` uses cross-origin resources (ex. loading a script from a 3rd party website
like Plaid or Stripe), you need to update your `cypress.json` and disable `chromeWebSecurity`.

```json
{
  // ...Other settings
  "chromeWebSecurity": false
}
```

Without this change, your `iframe` assets will not load due to CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)
issues.

## Selecting `iframe`s in Cypress

The simplest method to target elements within `iframe`s is to simply use Cypress's `then` method.
`then` yields the element from the previous command.

```javascript
cy.get('iframe').then($iframe => {
  const $body = $iframe.contents().find('body')

  cy.wrap($body).find('input').type('fake@email.com')
})
```

The issue with this approach is it doesn't ensure that the content within the `iframe` is available
yet. For example, this approach may test errors because the `body` element wasn't found when you
attempted to run `find('input')`.

To ensure that the `iframe` has loaded, we need a little more legwork:

```javascript
cy
  .get('iframe')
  .should(iframe => expect(iframe.contents().find('body').to.exist)
  .then(iframe => cy.wrap(iframe.contents().find('body')))
  .within({}, $iframe => {
    cy.get('input').type('fake@email.com')
  })
```

The primary improvement is the `should` method. `should` ensures that the iframe _has_ a `body`
before we attempt to run commands on it. Additionally, instead of returning the `iframe`'s `body` to
work off of, we can scope subsequent calls within the `body` element using `within`.

## Clean it up with a Cypress custom command

The code above it pretty gnarly. We can greatly DRY up the code by extracting it into a reusable
Cypress command:

```javascript
Cypress.Commands.add('iframe', { prevSubject: 'element' }, ($iframe, callback = () => {}) => {
  // For more info on targeting inside iframes refer to this GitHub issue:
  // https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/136
  cy.log('Getting iframe body')

  return cy
    .wrap($iframe)
    .should(iframe => expect(iframe.contents().find('body')).to.exist)
    .then(iframe => cy.wrap(iframe.contents().find('body')))
    .within({}, callback)
})
```

This command utilizes the previously found element, then ensures that the `iframe` has finished
loading before scoping the `iframe` `body` for subsequent calls.

Usage:

```javascript
cy.get('iframe').iframe(() => {
  // Targets the input within the iframe element
  cy.get('input').type('fake@email.com')
})
```

Clean code, baby!

## Timeouts

Don‚Äôt be afraid to set pretty high timeouts when working with `iframe`s. There‚Äôs a lot of room for
high latency because:

1. `iframe`s load a separate HTML document, which takes time to parse, execute, and render.
2. `iframe` assets don‚Äôt share the same cache as your app. This means every asset is downloaded as
   if were for the first time.
3. `iframe`s often load 3rd party scripts. In addition to downloading, parsing, and executing, this
   3rd party script may take time to initialize dynamic content.
4. The client‚Äôs network conditions may vary from you and your 3rd party‚Äôs servers.

When testing `iframe`s loaded by 3rd party scripts, I often reach for timeouts like so:

```javascript
cy.get('iframe').iframe(() => {
  cy.find('input', { timeout: 10 * 1000 }).type('fake@email.com')
})
```

The code above will look inside the `iframe` for the `input` element. If it finds the element, it
will resolve immediately and move on to the `type` method. Otherwise, it will wait 10sec before
erroring.

Note: Using `timeout` within Cypress commands is preferable to the generic `cy.wait`. Unlike
`timeout` , `cy.wait` will pause execution for the entirety of the time regardless of whether the
element is found or not. As a result, `cy.wait` tends to be much more brittle and cause intermittent
failures.

```javascript
// üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Wait 10sec
cy.wait(10 * 1000)

// üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Wait 10sec or less
cy.get('#el', { timeout: 10 * 1000 })
```

## `postMessage`

When working with `iframe`s, we sometimes use
[`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) to facilitate
communication between the `iframe` and our app.

One helpful use case is to notify the app that the `iframe` content has finished loading dynamic
content and is ready to receive user input.

For example, you might use the `postMessage` API to send your app a ready event after a few seconds.

```javascript
<!-- Inside the iframe -->
<script>
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.parent.postMessage({ code: 'Ready' }, e.origin)
  }, 3 * 1000)
</script>

// Inside your app
window.addEventListener('message', e => {
  var data = typeof e.data === 'string' ? JSON.parse(e.data) : e.data
  var code = data.code

  if (code === 'Ready') {
    alert('iframe is ready')
  }
})
```

If you use the `postMessage` API, using the command from the previous section may have a race
condition prone to intermittent failures.

Our custom `iframe` Cypress command only checks that the `iframe` element is in the ready state, but
that may not include dynamically rendered content.

If you have this issue, you can create another Cypress custom command `isIFrameReady` to listen for
the `Ready` event sent from your `iframe.html`.

```javascript
Cypress.Commands.add('isIFrameReady', () => {
  return cy.window().then({ timeout: 10 * 1000 }, window => {
    return new Cypress.Promise(resolve => {
      window.addEventListener('message', e => {
        const data = typeof e.data === 'string' ? JSON.parse(e.data) : e.data

        if (data.code === 'Ready') {
          resolve()
        }
      })
    })
  })
})
```

And using our two commands together:

```javascript
cy.isIFrameReady().then(() => {
  cy.get('iframe').iframe(() => {
    cy.get('input', { timeout: 10 * 1000 }).type('fake@email.com')
  })
})
```

## Wrapping up

Working with `iframe`s is a headache in Cypress, but I hope this post helps you overcome common
issues I ran into with them.
