This article is a part of _[React Hooks Deep Dive](../series/react-hooks-deep-dive)_, a series that
covers how to use each React hook, what problems they solve, and best practices so you can be
effective using them today.

In our previous installment of
[_React Hooks Deep Dive_](https://www.nicknish.co/series/react-hooks-deep-dive), we learned about
[**useReducer**](./react-hooks-deep-dive-usereducer) which centralizes complex state logic.

But we're stuck with a problem: How do we _share_ state between our components? If we wanted to
create a global state, is it possible with React?

Enter **useContext** which is used to cleanly and efficiently share state. No Redux. No tears. 100%
React.

Let’s dive in!

## The Issue with Props

Passing props is explicit, easy-to-understand, and quick. Generally, we should favor them over more
complex solutions.

However, when we use props to share state, our code can become verbose and hard to read and to
understand.

Consider the following example.

```jsx {8,12,16}
import React from 'react'

const Homepage = ({ theme }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        Nav
        <Button theme={theme}>Sign up</Button>
      </nav>
      <main>
        {/* ... */}
        <Button theme={theme}>Sign Up</Button>
      </main>
      <footer>
        Footer
        <Button theme={theme}>Sign up</Button>
      </footer>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Notice we pass `theme` to 3 `Button{:js}`s, but imagine a production app where we passed `theme` to
dozens of components. It would be a mess.

So what can we do when many components need to share the same state? There's got to be a better way
than “prop drilling” all the time, right?

## React Context

**React Context allows us to create state that is available to many components regardless of nesting
level**. It's particularly useful to create a "global" state similar to Redux.

Context uses a [**publish/subscribe model**](https://blog.stackpath.com/pub-sub/) aka pub-sub model.
This model defines a publisher, which emits events, and subscribers, which subscribe to those events
and change accordingly.

For our purposes, the context `Provider` component publishes state changes. Then, components can
subscribe to the state using `useContext`.

Let's take a look at how these individual pieces work, then put it all together.

### createContext

Before we can use context, we need to initialize a context first with `createContext`.

```javascript
const MyContext = createContext(defaultState)
```

**`createContext`** takes a default state value and returns a new Context object. The default value
is only used when the context is accessed without a `Provider` component (more on this next).

No need to be intimidated by the term "context object". This is simply the stateful value wrapped in
an object! This wrapper object allows React to read and update the context state, and importantly
contains the `Provider` component.

### Context Provider

The **`Provider`** component from the context object publishes state changes. With `Provider`, we
can change the state and publish those updates to subscribing components without passing any props.

```jsx {5-7}
const MyContext = createContext(defaultState)

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={initialState}>
      {/* child components */}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

An important constraint with React Context is **only children inside `Provider`’s subhierarchy can
access the context state**.

Now that we've created a context and set the publisher, aka `Provider`, we can subscribe to the
context state with `useContext`.

### useContext

The **`useContext`** hook allows `Provider`'s subcomponents to access and subscribe to the context
state.

```jsx {2}
const Component = () => {
  const value = useContext(MyContext)
  // ...
}
```

`useContext` takes the context object created by `createContext` and returns the stateful value.
When the `Provider` publishes new state updates, the component downstream invoking `useContext` will
receive the new state.

## Put it all together

This is a lot to keep in mind, so let's refactor our props example with React Context to see how
this all comes together.

```jsx {4,9,28}
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react'

// 1. Create Context object
const ThemeContext = createContext(null)

const Homepage = ({ theme }) => {
  return (
    // 2. Set state and publish state updates
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <nav>
        Nav
        <Button>Sign up</Button>
      </nav>
      <main>
        {/* ... */}
        <Button>Sign Up</Button>
      </main>
      <footer>
        Footer
        <Button>Sign up</Button>
      </footer>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

const Button = ({ children }) => {
  // 3. Access context state and subscribe to changes
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)

  return <button className={theme}>{children}</button>
}
```

[See the full CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/blog-post-template-v3-d6oq0?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark).

This is freaking awesome! Using React Context, we've cleaned up our code by removing repeated props.
Without adding a single dependency, we have created a "global" state that subcomponents can access
without passing props.

### Updating context state

To update our context state, we simply pass a new value to our `Provider`. We can use state to
dynamically pass a new value for example.

```jsx {10}
import React, { useState, createContext, useContext } from 'react'

const ThemeContext = createContext(null)

const Homepage = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('blue')

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <Button onClick={() => setTheme('green')}>Change Theme</Button>
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

const Button = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)

  return (
    <button className={theme} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Setting the updater to context

The above example works fine, but we're passing around the `setTheme` prop now. What if we added
`setTheme` to the context state as well?

```jsx {9}
import React, { useState, createContext, useContext } from 'react'

const ThemeContext = createContext(null)

const Homepage = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('blue')

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={[theme, setTheme]}>
      <Button onClick={() => setTheme('green')}>Change Theme</Button>
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

const Button = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  const [theme] = useContext(ThemeContext)

  return (
    <button className={theme} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

Nice! But we've introduced a performance issue.

Whenever a component using `useContext` reexecutes, React runs a shallow equality check on the
context stateful value. If the previous value does not equal the new value, then React will rerender
the component.

Because we pass `[theme, setTheme]` to the `Provider`, the `Button` will rerender every time
`Homepage` rerenders because we create a new array every render.

We can fix this by creating a _new_ Context object for the updater method.

```jsx {4,10,15}
import React, { useState, createContext, useContext } from 'react'

const ThemeContext = createContext(null)
const ThemeUpdateContext = createContext(null)

const Homepage = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('blue')

  return (
    <ThemeUpdateContext.Provider value={setTheme}>
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
        <Button onClick={() => setTheme('green')}>Change Theme</Button>
        <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    </ThemeUpdateContext.Provider>
  )
}

const Button = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  const [theme] = useContext(ThemeContext)

  return (
    <button className={theme} {...props}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

React Context performance is a large enough topic to warrant a future post, but for now keep this in
mind when using saving multiple items in context.

## Best Practice: Code Cleanliness

As a final note, I recommend extracting your Context logic into a separate file like so:

```jsx title="src/contexts/theme.js"
import React, { useState, createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext(null)
export const ThemeUpdateContext = createContext(null)

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('blue')

  return (
    <ThemeUpdateContext.Provider value={setTheme}>
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
    </ThemeUpdateContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

The result is an easy-to-use-and-understand API to access and update your context state.

## Next up: useEffect

**useContext** is a powerful way to share state in our components and massively clean up our code.

I generally dive into a few more examples but we had a lot of ground to cover. I will post
additional examples in separate posts following this one.

In the next article, we’ll do a deep dive on useEffect, which will allow our components to perform
side effects like data-fetching and event handlers!
