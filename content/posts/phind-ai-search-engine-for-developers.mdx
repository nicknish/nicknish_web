You're stumped on a one-off coding problem. Or maybe you've gained experience in software
engineering, and you now have questions that are more ambiguous, contextual, and without a silver
bullet. To find guidance, it can be challenging to know what queries to use in a traditional search
engine like Google Search. You might need to skim many articles, papers, and documentation before
you grasp a solution.

## [Phind.com](https://www.phind.com)

Enter [Phind.com](https://www.phind.com), the A.I. Search Engine for developers. Similar to OpenAI's
Chat-GPT, Phind enables you to perform text-based prompts to find A.I. generated answers, but the
experience is designed for developers.

I've been using Phind for a few days and it's been an delight to use. Phind has helped me with an
array of different questions, from one-offs to more complex topics like Micro Frontends. I've been
so pleased, I felt compelled to talk about it.

## What I love about Phind

Simply put, Phind's best features are its UX and product quality. The UX feels specifically tailored
for software engineering and the search results are generally very high quality. You might have to
try it to believe it.

Phind not only answers your questions by aggregating and composing high-quality sources across the
internet, but also lists those sources for you to learn more. I love this! Original authors get
credit too and I prefer to build knowledge with a breadth of established resources.

Phind will also suggest follow-up questions based on your original prompt and the answer. This is
wonderful as it helps you know what questions you should be asking, as well as let you dive deeper
into an existing prompt. Compared to Chat-GPT where every prompt feels somewhat disconnected from
the last.

Like Chat-GPT, each new top-level search adds to a stack of recent searches on the left hand side so
you can jump between threads.

Finally, another favorite feature is that Phind search results modify the url with a query parameter
(e.g. `?cache=1234-5678`) so you can share the results. I was working with a friend who had a
specific CSS question that I wasn't sure about. I asked Phind and saw solution that I could
recommend. I sent him the link and he was able to view it instantly. I'm not sure how long the
result is cached, but it was a delightful experience.

If you try Phind, I'd love to know what you think too!
