Hey, you savvy developer and/or creative person! 

We all know that email newsletters have made a big comeback! Newsletters are a great way to keep current with tech, developer news, or other interests. With the absolute firehose of content on the internet, newsletters have become crucial to curate the best content to read. Isn‚Äôt that why you‚Äôre here? üòâ

In this annual blog post, I want to share some of my favorites of 2019. 

## Inbox Zero

I‚Äôm a big believer in Inbox Zero. Inbox Zero is a movement to keep your inbox empty!

With all these newsletters, it can be a challenge to keep a trim inbox and I‚Äôve spent the last few years looking for a solution to this. 

Previously I used [Unroll.me](http://unroll.me) but I immediately stopped when it was unveiled that [they scan and sell your data](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/personal-data-firm-slice-unroll-me-backlash-uber.html). 

Recently I‚Äôve been using and loving the free iOS app [Stoop Inbox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stoop-inbox/id1438978466). The app first provides a custom @stoopinbox.com email address to use for newsletters, then it provides a Pocket-type reading experience for them. I‚Äôve been unsubscribing to all newsletters and signing up again with my Stoop email and my inbox is cleeean ‚ú®
