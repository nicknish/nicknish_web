__NPM__ stands for __Node Package Manager__. 

What is a __package manager__? Instead of always programming everything from scratch, a package manager allows you to reuse other people's code in a clear, safe manner. 

"Reuse other people's code" sounds a bit crazy, right? But you're probably already doing this when you use libraries like ReactJS and jQuery. Other people have authored that code, and you're using it. A package manager system manages the _dependencies_, or other code that you require.

There are many package managers, but NPM is specifically for code written in JavaScript to be used in the [Node.js environment](/blog/explain-it-like-im-5-nodejs). More than just a tool, NPM is also a vibrant online community and catalog for tons of different "modules" for public and private use.
