__Frontend__ (also spelled *Front End*, *Front-End*) refers to __Frontend Development__. The frontend's responsibilities lie primarily in displaying data that is provided by the backend. In web development, the frontend uses markup, styling, and functionality (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) at its core.

__Backend__ (also spelled *Back End*, *Back-End*) refers to __Backend Development__. The backend's responsibilities include storing data with the database, serving data to the frontend, user authentication. Due to the separation of the frontend, the backend is not limited to any particular language or technology stack. Examples: NodeJS, Rails, Scala, PHP, and more.

__Full Stack__ refers to __Full Stack Development__. A full stack developer is one who has expertise in both frontend and backend development, and can adeptly move "up and down the [technology] stack".

Imagine a restaurant. The waiter (frontend) takes and sends your order to the kitchen. The kitchen (backend) prepares your order. When the kitchen receives your order, it prepares it, and the waiter deliver the order to you.

Fun fact: A restaurant kitchen is called "back-of-the-house" and the server crew is called the "front-of-the-house".
