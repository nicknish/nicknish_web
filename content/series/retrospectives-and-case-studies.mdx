description: Retrospective meetings are a commonly used tool in the tech sector to review and reflect on the past project or development cycle to identify what went well, what didn't, and to plan for improvement in the future. This series of articles explores past projects and dissects their process from start to finish in order to provide insights and learnings from making software development projects.
