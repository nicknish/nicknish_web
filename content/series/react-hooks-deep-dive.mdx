description: React.js Hooks are a way to manage and update state and component logic in functional components. They allow you to use state and other React features, providing a way to reuse stateful logic and avoid state management complexity. They can simplify code by eliminating the need for HOCs and render props. Using hooks results in cleaner, more concise and easier to maintain code, improving the developer experience. However, React hooks can be confusing and hard to learn. This series explores React Hooks deeply and how you can master them.
