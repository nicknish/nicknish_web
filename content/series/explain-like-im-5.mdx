description: What do the terms API, Frontend, Backend really mean? Programming and technology terminology can be confusing and complex. This series of articles explains this often-used, but confusing terminology in the simplest ways.

This series explains basic developer and programming concepts in their most simple (by simple, I
mean not _abstract_) terms. The title is a bit click-baity, but the point is I'm imagining
explaining these concepts to a new developer.

Many of these concepts are ones I found difficult to understand or intimidating to learn when I was
first becoming a developer. It was absolutely daunting to know what I didn't know. This aims to
solve it by breaking things down into their most simplest concepts and becoming a reference to other
helpful resources.
